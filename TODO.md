## Docs export

- `show_doc` changes:
  - support `#default_cls_lvl`
  - pick header level for functions/methods
- Back-tick linking
- implement stuff from nbdev export2html, e.g.(?):
  - `remove_widget_state`
- tmp.ipynb tests are flaky
- Provide minimal bootstrap for people getting started (Hamel is currently working on this)

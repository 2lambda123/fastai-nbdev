    "\n",
    "Blogging with notebooks can offer a dramatic quality of life improvement over writing in Markdown, especially for blog posts that contain code.  Previously, there were no static site generators that supported Jupyter Notebooks as a first-class authoring medium.  This previously led us to create [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) (now deprecated), which extended [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to enable blogging directly with Jupyter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Enter Quarto\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there now exists [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a wonderful publishing system with rich support for authoring via Jupyter Notebooks.  \n",

    "Some helpful resources on getting started with Quarto:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [The Quarto Homepage](https://quarto.org/)\n",

    "\n",
    "If you previously had a fastpages site, we offer some utilities to help migrate you to Quarto.  **The migration is not holistic: you will likely have to manually correct some things that we are not able to automate.**\n",

    "5. Your new repo will have a `posts/` directory.  This is where you will copy all of your notebook and markdown posts from fastpages.  For example, let's say your fastpages blog repo is in a sibling directory located at `../blog/`, you would copy all the relevant posts like this: \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Do I need to migrate from fastpages?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "    No you do not.  However we will not be actively supporting fastpages going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Will migrating from fastpages to Quarto take lots of manual effort?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    You will have to do some manual work to make sure everything looks and works the same, including converting Jekyll shortcodes to equivalent Quarto commands.  However, we have automated the biggest aspects for you. Please see [Migrating from fastpages](#migrating-from-fastpages) for instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **I cannot find something in Quarto that does what `#collapse_output` did in fastpages**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Correct, this is a feature that isn't supported in Quarto yet.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why am I seeing `{% twitter ...%}` and `{% fn_detail ... %}` and other `{%...%}` commands in my Quarto blog posts?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    These are Jekyll shortcodes that you will have to manually migrate to Quarto.  For example with the twitter embeds, you can insert the appropriate HTML as [recommended by Twitter](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-embed-a-tweet#:~:text=Click%20the%20icon%20located%20within,by%20clicking%20set%20customization%20options).  For footnotes, you can see [these docs](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html).  For other items, you should search the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) for how to enable your desired result.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. **I created a new blog post and used `#| hide` but the cell is still showing.  What is wrong?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    You must use Quarto directives, not nbdev-specific ones.  See the difference between the two [in these docs](../explanations/directives.ipynb).  This is because you are blogging with Quarto, not nbdev.  The exception to this is you have a blog site in your nbdev project -- in that case, nbdev-specific directives will work. \n",
    "    \n",
    "6.  **How do I enable comments on my blog posts?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    In general, Quarto offers all of the same features and much more than fastpages did, including comments.  If you search the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/) for comments, you will see a [page for enabling comments](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#commenting).\n",
    "    \n",
    "7.  **How do I sort and hide posts?  What about the publishing date since that's not in the filename?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    See the Quarto docs on [creating a blog](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) as well as [listing pages](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html).\n",
    "    \n",
    "8.  **How do I customize my site?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    See the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **How do I do set up RSS Feeds and add particular features to my site?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    See the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html)\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. **What does nbdev have to do with Quarto?**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For just blogging, nothing!  You can use Quarto for blogging without worrying about nbdev.  In the past, we maintained a nbdev related project called [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), and are recommending that people migrate to Quarto if possible.  Furthermore, nbdev is built on top of Quarto which means much of the functionality is similar.  Finally, you can incorporate blogs into a nbdev project site, which we discuss in [this section](#creating-a-blog-within-a-nbdev-project).\n",
    "    \n",
    "9. **For stand alone blogs, why are you directing us to Quarto, can I just use nbdev?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    nbdev is built on top of Quarto. For the purposes of blogging, adding nbdev is of little additional benefit if all you want to do is to blog.  We decided to keep things simple and let people use Quarto directly instead of trying to abstract aspects of Quarto for blogging.  Furthermore, having some knowledge of Quarto can be very helpful in using nbdev!.  Lastly, you can still use some nbdev features in your blog, which are listed in [this article](modular_nbdev.ipynb)."
